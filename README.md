Running Leap Locally
===
Leap uses Jekyll for templating and such. This means you'll need to get Jekyll up and running in order to view and edit the site on your own machine. Jekyll will handle rendering the pages and compiling Sass, so no need to run `sass --watch` or anything like that.

To get Jekyll running follow these steps:

* Open Terminal and navigate to where your project-leap site folder lives
* Run `bundle install`
* After that finishes, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* Go to your browser and load up `localhost:4000/project-leap/`

Way to go, nerd. You should be up and running now!

Grid
---
Let's utilize a mobile-first approach and have mobile be the default. The rest of the classes will override eachother as they cascade, letting us give alternate styles to override mobile within our responsive breakpoints. Containers won't have gutters by default but we can add a class to the container to do auto gutters. Can also apply padding atoms to individual columns to control gutter with a bit more granularity.

* [x] Column Sizes (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 33, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100)

Typography
---
We utilize Gotham Rounded for all of our web typography. Maybe we should include a download of it for people to use while prototyping?

#### Headers and Sizing
We can provide styling for default `<h1> - <h6>`, as well as, utility classes for applying different sizes to the default elements so that we can control markup hierarchy while still applying the sizes we want visually.

Block Grid (1 - 6)
---
Used when a layout has a variable number of alike items that need to be presented in a grid. We will only provide options for rows of block from 1 through 6 since those are most common for this type of grid layout. Default to mobile-first and can be overriden by responsive prefixes to get variable layouts between breakpoints.
